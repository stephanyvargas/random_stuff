## Learning GIT BRANCHING

Use this url of git branching https://learngitbranching.js.org/ to learn git online. 
I am keeping track of the lessons and some side material here =).

### Git commit
A commit in a git repository records a snapshot of all the (tracked) files in your directory. It's like a giant copy and paste.
Git wants to keep commits as lightweight as possible though, so it doesn't just blindly copy the entire directory every time you commit. It can (when possible) compress a commit as a set of changes, or a "delta", from one version of the repository to the next.

Git also maintains a history of which commits were made when. That's why most commits have ancestor commits above them.
```python3
git commit 
```
